    <article class="project"><h3><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics" target="_blank">Mastering Semantic HTML</a></h3>
    <p>Semantic HTML is the use of HTML elements that <br>
    clearly describe their meaning and purpose, such<br>
    as header, nav, article, section, and footer.<br>
    This approach improves accessibility for screen readers,<br>
    enhances Search Engine Optimization (SEO) by making content<br>
    more understandable to crawlers, and makes web page code<br>
    more organized, readable, and maintainable for developers.<br>
    It contrasts with non-semantic HTML, which uses generic <br>
    tags like div and span to structure content without providing<br>
     inherent meaning.</p>

    <article class="project"><h3><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript" target="_blank">Mastering JavaScript</a></h3>
    <p> JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamically typed programming<br>
        language primarily known for enabling interactive and dynamic <br>
        content on websites. It operates as a core technology of<br>
     the World Wide Web, alongside HTML (for structure) and CSS (for styling).</p>

    <article class="project"><h3><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">Styling With CSS</a></h3>
    <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language <br>
    used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML <br>
    (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML, or XHTML). It is one of the <br>
    core languages of the open web. CSS describes how elements should be rendered <br>
     on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. It allows web developers to <br>
      control the visual appearance of web content</p>
